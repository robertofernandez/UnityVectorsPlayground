# UnityVectorsPlayground

**VectorsPlayground** is a project designed to explore the use of vectors, distance constraints, and geometric transformations to create and animate elements based on mathematical relationships. The main goal is to demonstrate how to build and animate vector-based systems, laying the groundwork for more complex projects like physics simulations or visual constructions.

**UnityVectorsPlayground** is the Unity version of **VectorsPlayground**. It leverages its 2D engine to create and animate the elements.

### **Features**  
- üé® **Dynamic Drawing:** Programmatic rendering of elements like circles, lines, and connections between points.
- ‚ú® **Interactivity:** Mouse event handling to dynamically update positions and maintain distance constraints.
- üîó **Vector Constraints:** Implementation of fixed-distance relationships between points.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Extensibility:** A robust foundation for expanding into more advanced systems, such as animal or vehicle constructions using vector relationships.

### **Technologies Used**  
- **Unity Unity 6000+**: Game engine for 2D and 3D development.
- **C#**: Primary language for logic and vector calculations.
- **UnityEngine.Vector2**: Extensive use of Unity's vector API for spatial calculations.

### **How to Run the Project**  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UnityVectorsPlayground.git
   cd UnityVectorsPlayground
   ```
2. Open the project in Unity (recommended version: Unity 6000.0.24f1 or later).  
3. Load the `MainScene`.
4. Click **Play** to interact with the system.
